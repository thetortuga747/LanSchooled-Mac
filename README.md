# LanSchooled-Mac
The most effective teacher evasion tool, designed for the Macbook Air. 

With a simple UI that allows for discrete activation of services, LanSchooled is the perfect app for the conniving student
wishing to hide the contents of his desktop (YouTube, games, essays?, world domination plots) from his or her teachers.

By pressing Caps Lock, the user can toggle a disguise for their screen; either a solid black window or a full
resolution screenshot of their desktop. 

This app is not fully compatible with Windows. Use only within an OSX environment is highly recommended.
